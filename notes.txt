- Combinators:
  1. (+): Adjacent Sibling
    a. Example: 
       h2 + p {
        color: red;
       }
    b. This assigns to all P that directly follow an h2 tag. It must be a direct sibling.
    c. Elements must share the same parent. Second element comes immediately after first element.
    d. Example:
    <div>
      <h2>Not Applied</h2>
      <p>CSS Applied</P>
      <h3>Not Applied</h3>
      <p>Not Applied</p>
      <h2>Not Applied</h2>
      <p>CSS Applied</p>
    </div>
  2. (~): General Sibling
    a. Example: 
      h2 ~ p {
        color: red;
      }
    b. Example:
      <div>
        <h2>Not Applied</h2>
        <p>CSS Applied</P>
        <h3>Not Applied</h3>
        <p>CSS Applied</p>
        <h2>Not Applied</h2>
        <p>CSS Applied</p>
      </div>
    c. There only needs to be an h2 sibling in this case, it does not need to be directly in front of it.
    d. Elements share the same parent. Second element comes after first element.
  3. (>): Child
    a. Second element is a direct child of first element
  4. ( ): Descendant
    a. Does not have to be a direct child of first element

- Box Model
  1. Margin, padding, border and content
    a. Each element is a box, hence the box model

- Margin Collapsing
  1. The bigger margin between two elements "wins" and don't combine.
    a. In general: Use either margin-top or margin-bottom to avoid this

- Width
  1. Setting the width to a percentage, takes the percentage of the element that is containing it.

- Box-Sizing
  1. By default, content, padding and border are excluded in the size of a box
    a. example: box-sizing: content-box;
    b. This means, if we set a height and width of the box, we are setting the sizes of the content, not including padding and border
  2. To include border and padding in the size of a box (setting the height and height):
    a. box-sizing: border-box
    b. this is more convenient to think about the size of a box including padding, border and margin

- Inline-block
  1. display: inline-block
    a. this means that the element will display on the same line as sibling elements
    b. will behave like block elements when it comes to setting margins, padding etc. However, this will display them on the same line.
    c. <a> element do this be default

- Block-level vs Inline Elements:
It's not really a CSS topic, though it's related to it: The difference between block-level and inline elements.

You can read a more detailed article (which also includes a YouTube video about HTML at the top of the page) here: https://academind.com/learn/html/beginner-s-guide/diving-deeper-into-html#block-level-vs-inline-elements

Here's the executive summary:

Block-level elements are rendered as a block and hence take up all the available horizontal space. You can set margin-top and margin-bottom and two block-level elements will render in two different lines.

Some examples are: <div> , <section> , <article> , <nav>  but also <h1> , <h2>  etc and <p> .

Inline elements on the other hand only take up the space they require to fit their content in. Hence two inline-elements will fit into the same line (as long as the combined content doesn't take up the entire space in which case a line break would be added).

They also use the box-model you learned about but margin-top  and margin-bottom  have no effect on the element. padding-top  and padding-bottom  also have a different effect. They don't push the adjacent content away but they will do so with the element border. You can read more about that behavior in the following article: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/03/understanding-inline-box-model/

Additionally, setting a width  or height  on an inline element also has no effect. The width and height is auto to take as much space as required by the content.

Logically, this makes sense since you don't want your inline elements to destroy your multi-line text-layout. If you want to do so or need both block-level and inline behavior, you can set display: inline-block  to merge behaviors.

Some example elements are: <a> , <span> , <img>
